Analyze Optimized Bubble Sort Time Complexity

1. Count Operations
Input Array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 25, 3, 8, 4, 25, 3, 8, 4, 2]

To manually count operations, let’s walk through the optimized Bubble Sort process for this array:

Initial Array:
[5, 3, 8, 4, 25, 3, 8, 4, 25, 3, 8, 4, 2]

Outer Loop Iteration 1 (i=0):
Number of comparisons = n - i - 1 = 12
Swaps:

- Compare 5 and 3: Swap → [3, 5, 8, ...]
- Compare 5 and 8: No Swap
- Compare 8 and 4: Swap → [3, 5, 4, 8, ...]
- Continue similarly...

Total comparisons: 12, Total swaps: 10

Outer Loop Iteration 2 (i=1):
Number of comparisons = n - i - 1 = 11
Swaps: Proceed similarly, noting only necessary swaps.

After counting all iterations, we'll have the total number of comparisons and swaps.

2. Mathematical Analysis
In the optimized version of Bubble Sort:
- The number of comparisons for an array of size n is:
  Total Comparisons = (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = (n-1) * n / 2
  For n = 13, this is:
  (13-1) * 13 / 2 = 78 comparisons

- The time complexity is still O(n²) in the worst case but reduced due to fewer comparisons.

3. Best Case
The best-case scenario occurs when the array is already sorted.
- Behavior: No swaps are performed, and the algorithm only goes through the comparisons once.
- Number of Comparisons: n - 1. For n = 13, there are 12 comparisons.
- Time Complexity: O(n) due to early termination after detecting no swaps.

Summary:
1. Optimized Bubble Sort reduces unnecessary comparisons in already sorted sections of the array.
2. Best-case performance improves to O(n) when the array is already sorted.
3. Worst-case time complexity remains O(n²).
